This project objective is to investigate the use of the Grails camunda plugin in a shared container.

The official grails-camunda-plugin src was modified to fix an issue with the 'embedded' mode where the configuration key
can be set as a flat String using dot notation or a hierarchical structure as used by YAML configurations.

To deploy in a shared container it is important that only the correct jar files are in the webapp LIB directory.
In this case,for Grails, the camunda-engine-spring.jar is the relevant jar.
